Gears In Motion
Description

Gears In Motion is a user interface to manage Google Gears databases. It is similar in many ways to standard database interfaces, but focus on what really matters: your data !

It runs within the browser and we provide a standalone version that you can include in the developpement versions of your projects.

It also detects foreign keys to display linked elements, using the Ruby on Rails naming conventions.
